                <br /><p>Even though vulnerability assessment is very helpful, there are reasons why some people don't do it regularly — or why it's not enough on its own.</p>

                  <div className="challenge-item">
                    <h4>1. Limited Depth</h4>
                    <p>Vulnerability assessment only finds weaknesses, but it doesn't test how deep or dangerous they are.</p>
                    <div className="highlight">👉 It says "there's a hole", but not "can someone break in through it?"</div>

                  <div className="challenge-item">
                    <h4>2. Cost and Resources</h4>
                    <p>Small businesses may skip it because they think it's too expensive or don't have security staff to handle it.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div className="challenge-item">
                    <h4>3. Time and Effort</h4>

                    <h4>4. False Sense of Security</h4>
                    <p>Some companies think a vulnerability scan means they're fully protected, but it's only the first step, not the full test like penetration testing.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div className="challenge-item">
                    <h4>5. Requires Action</h4>
                    <p>The assessment only finds problems — someone still needs to fix them (patch systems, update software, etc.). If no one acts on the report, the weaknesses remain.</p>
